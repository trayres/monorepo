* Introduction
This document is a brief showcase of using Emacs & Org-mode to export longer form documents and leverage them in web projects going forward. It introduces digital design through a minimal example targeted to a [[https://digilent.com/shop/nexys-video-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-for-multimedia-applications/][Nexys Video FPGA board]].

* A 'Hello, World!' for Digial Design
We're going to create an absolutely minimal project; a "Hello, World!" for digital design.
** Vivado Project Steps
*** Open Vivado and Create a Project
I'm using Vivado 2021.2; most recent versions of Vivado look similar. Open Vivado and click on "Create Project".

[[./vivado_click_create_project.png]]

*** New Project Wizard
On the New Project Wizard page, click Next.
[[./vivado_create_a_new_vivado_project.png]]

*** Project Name and Location
Choose a project name and a location. Note that you can have Vivado create the project directory for you with the "Create project subdirectory" checkbox.
[[./vivado_create_project_name.png]]

*** Project Type
Set the project type as in the below image; this will give you a basic project. We will add our "Hello, World!" code soon after!
Click "Next".
[[./vivado_project_type.png]]

*** Select Part
Next we'll have to tell Vivado what part we intend to use.

In the search box, type: xc7a200tsbg484, and select the speed grade 1 part as indicated. 

Note that FPGAs vary in packages, speed, logic capacity, and their part numbers can be confusing. We are skipping a tremendous amount of detail in the interests of expediency.

As an exercise, you should look at the [[https://digilent.com/shop/nexys-video-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-for-multimedia-applications/][Digilent reference page for the Nexys Video]]. You can also look at the [[https://digilent.com/reference/_media/reference/programmable-logic/nexys-video/nexys_video_sch.pdf][schematic for the board]].
You *will* become comfortable with both the reference documentation and the schematics of the boards you use!
For now, click "Next".

*** Project Summary
Vivado will now show you a project summary, to confirm the choices you've made thus far. If you've made all the same choices as indicated in this tutorial, it should look like this:

** Significance of "Hello, World!"
This seems very brief; even laughable. What does this really do?

* A Brief and Minimal Exercise
So you have decided to learn digital design; after purchasing your development board, you want to see "something", but you're not quite sure what? You've come to the right place.

** So... what now?
We're going to connect a handful of buttons, a logic gate, and an LED. Is it the world's most impressive thing? No, but this is "baseline sanity".

** Baseline sanity?
