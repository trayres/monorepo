* Introduction
The intent of this book is to document things that may (or may not) be useful for others who are interested in digital design and retrocomputing.

** FPGA4Fun
This website has a great introduction to HDMI, including source code; I modified it slightly to fit one of my FPGA boards and fired it up.
